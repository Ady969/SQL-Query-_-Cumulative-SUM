**ðŸš€ SQL Interview Question: Cumulative Sum / Running Total**  

In SQL interviews, a common question is:  
ðŸ‘‰ *How do you calculate the cumulative sum (running total) of salaries in a table?*  

ðŸ’¡ Hereâ€™s a simple solution using the **SUM() OVER()** window function:  

```sql
SELECT emp_id, empname, salary,  
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS cumulative_sum  
FROM employees;
```

âœ… This query calculates the running total of salaries, ordered by `emp_id`.  

ðŸ“Œ *Why is this useful?*  
- Helps in financial reporting ðŸ“Š  
- Used in trend analysis ðŸ“ˆ  
- Common in business intelligence dashboards
